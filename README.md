Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) based on Spotify Tracks Dataset

The objective of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "Spotify Tracks" dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary aim is to delve into factors influencing the popularity of songs based on the numerical parameters provided in the dataset columns.

The process begins with loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and examining its structure and contents. Following this, data cleaning procedures are implemented to handle missing values, remove duplicates, thus maintaining the dataset's integrity. Descriptive statistics is computed for numerical columns, providing insights of the data. Visualizations play a crucial role in this analysis, utilizing matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create various plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. These visualizations help in visually inspecting distributions, relationships, and correlations among numerical variables. Correlation analysis is performed to calculate correlation coefficients between numerical variables, revealing potential relationships and dependencies. This step aids in understanding which features may have a significant impact on song popularity.

Overall, this comprehensive approach to EDA helps uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset, paving the way for further analysis and modeling.
