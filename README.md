Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) based on Spotify Tracks Dataset

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "Spotify Tracks" dataset acquired from Kaggle. The main focus is to explore the various numerical parameters in the dataset columns to understand their impact on each other.

The process begins with loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and examining its structure and contents. Following this, data cleaning procedures are implemented to handle missing values, remove duplicates, thus maintaining the dataset's integrity. Descriptive statistics is computed for numerical columns, providing insights of the data. Visualizations play a crucial role in this analysis, utilizing matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create various plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. These visualizations help in visually inspecting distributions, relationships, and correlations among numerical variables. Correlation analysis is performed to calculate correlation coefficients between numerical variables, revealing potential relationships and dependencies. This step aids in understanding which features may have a significant impact on song popularity.

Overall, this comprehensive approach to EDA helps uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset, paving the way for further analysis and modeling.
